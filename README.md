# Django Workshop Exercise 8

In this exercise we will apply a user restriction logic to the application so that only admin users have access to the Person creation page.
<br/><br/>
## 1. Prepare for the coding environment  

SSH into the test machine. The password is 123456.
```sh
ssh your_upi@130.216.39.213
```
Once you are in, activate the python virtual environment and cd into the project folder
```sh
workon dj && cd mysite
```
